                        Kyiv (or Kiev), Ukraine's capital, is a large city located on
                        the shores of the Dnipro river. Of course, no one in their right
                        mind would swim in the river, unless they grew up here, in which
                        case they've probably tried it at some point. Summers are hot
                        here, and the winters are drafty, but the fall and the spring
                        are are absolutely amazing.

                    <p class="place__paragraph">
                        The city itself is a mix of pre-revolution, post-war and soviet
                        architecture, all of it sprinkled with modified balconies. If
                        you're on the right bank of the Dnipro, the landscape is
                        difficult to traverse for people on bikes and those wearing
                        heels. The left bank is considered far less interesting and
                        prestigious though, even by people who live on the far outskirts
                        of the right one.

                        The medieval ruin of Cricieth Castle overlooks the town below
                        from a rock that juts out into the sea. It is thought to have
                        been built by Llewelyn the Great in the 13th century. Some 900
                        years later, the self-styled Pearl of Wales on the Shores of
                        Snowdonia has become a popular tourist destination during the
                        summer months.

                    <p class="place__paragraph">
                        A short walk down the road from the castle, you can enjoy the
                        world's best ice cream at Cadwalader's, whose secret ingredient
                        is rumored to be locally sourced seaweed. Another claim to fame
                        is the fact that Cricieth won the Wales in Bloom award for five
                        years in a row for its spectacular floral displays around town.
                        It was also home to David Lloyd George, the only Welshman ever
                        to hold the office of Prime Minister of the UK.

                        Berea is a small town located in the central part of Kentucky.
                        The town is surrounded by beautiful forests and countryside.
                        It's known as the arts and crafts capital of the state, and
                        visitors will find plenty of shopping opportunities: shops with
                        handmade jewelry, candles, wood items, galleries, glass studios,
                        and more. The town holds a yearly festival celebrating
                        "spoonbread", a local dish made with cornbread and served with a
                        wooden spoon.

                        However, it's probably known best for the local college. Berea
                        College was founded in 1855 and was the first college in the
                        south to be racially integrated, as well as the first to be
                        coeducational. Somewhat uniquely, it charges no tuition — every
                        student receives a full-tuition scholarship.

                        Muramvya is one of the 18 provinces of Burundi. In the kingdom
                        era, Muramvya was the royal capital and in 2007, because of its
                        cultural and natural landscape, it was added to the UNESCO World
                        Heritage Tentative List. It is located in the center of Burundi,

                        sea level, Mount Teza is one of the coldest places in the
                        province. But that cool breeze allows for one of the largest

                        Baku is the capital of Azerbaijan. It lies on the western shore

                        Peninsula gives protection from violent northerly winds.The
                        name Baku is possibly a contraction of the Persian bad kube

                        of narrow alleys and ancient buildings. Around the walls of the fortress,
                        the regular streets and imposing buildings of modern Baku rise up the
